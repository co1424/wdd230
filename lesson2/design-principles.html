                    Samsung's website does a good job at keeping everything clean and clutter free, which is what the white space and clean design principle does. It makes sure of using the least amount of irrelevant things off the page, and just keep the most important details to entice the user to dig in deeper.

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/"> [Family Search Site]</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img class="screenshot" src="familysearch.JPG"

                <p>
                    Fitt's law states that whatever the user might be more likely be looking for should be at first glance in the page and easy to access. Big buttons and location can make a big difference on whether the user stays or not. In this case this Family Search site does a good job at keeping the main options easy to find withing the navegation bar and hamburger menu.

                <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"> [Spotify Premium Site] </a>                   
                        
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img class="screenshot" src="spotify.JPG"
                    alt="Spotify Screenshot">
                <p>
                    Hick's Law says that the fewer amount of choices the better. Most of the time the choices given are what the company wants them to do the most. In this case Spotify wants them to start the trial or shop for plans. This is a great example of only giving them two main options. This site does not meet proper responsiveness, but does well at Hick's Law.
