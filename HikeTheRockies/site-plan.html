    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Hello there! I’m a Software Engineer who has found hiking both frustrating and enjoyable.
      Frustrating because I cannot find good places to hike, and enjoyable because once I find a good spot,
      I love it. If you are like me, you would get up on Saturday morning looking for a place to visit,
      but do not know where to start. Here is where my site comes in! Pictures, reviews, hiker tips, and more,
      all in one place which makes it easier for you to decide where to go to. I will also include hike
      difficulty depending on how hard you would like your hike to be.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Dear hikers! Yes, you! From the amateur to the expert type. They will find fun things to do
      here. Mostly in ages between 18-35 years old in the Rexburg Idaho area. Both males and females
      will benefit from this site. This will allow you to find lots of fun in one place. </p> <!-- change this -->
